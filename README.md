# Roadmap
This roughly describes the roadmap (not in order) for automating my home

I'm trying to approach it with a BDD approach and will aim to document the requirements with [Gherkin style feature files](./Features)

## Cluster
- [x] mixed x64, x86, arm docker swarm cluster (swarm over kubenetes only for native simplicity)
    - https://github.com/pinked/infra
    - https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/apps/stack-yaml-reference/
    - https://medium.com/@chanwit/cross-platform-hybrid-cloud-with-docker-ded000f792fb
- [ ] long term containerized volume on demand distributed + replicated persistence magic
    - https://github.com/djmaze/docker-gluster-cluster
    - https://github.com/aravindavk/glusterfs-rest
- [x] interm host based replicated volume storage
    - gluster
- [x] resiliant and self recovering clustered mqtt
    - https://github.com/pinked/clustered-verneMQ
- [x] ingress DNS based controller
    - https://github.com/pinked/infra
- [x] https on ingress
    - http://api.heartinternet.co.uk/api2.html#uid-d--dns-commands--update-dns
    - https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh

    - https://customer.heartinternet.uk/manage/api
- [x] CI/CD
    - https://github.com/pinked/clustered-drone
    - [x] external access via localtunnel.me
    - [x] application firewall/naxsi between localtunnel.me and drone to verify its a valid request from github
      - https://github.com/chrisns/localtunnel-whitelisted
    - [x] drone doing deploys to the swarm
    - [x] drone volume persistence in swarm [blocked by no gluster]
- [x] pin zwave+rfxcom docker containers to hardware that supports it
    - docker swarm labels
